description: A fast, lightweight CLI and MCP server for Bitbucket in Go.
---

**bbkt** is a dual-mode Command-Line Interface and [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that gives users and AI assistants full access to your Bitbucket repositories.

## Why bbkt?

Instead of relying on web scraping or manual context-dropping, this tool directly interfaces with the Bitbucket REST API v2 to expose repository context to any terminal session or MCP-compliant client.

- **Fast & Lightweight:** Built in Go without heavy runtime dependencies.
- **Deep Integration:** Create pull requests, merge code, approve reviews, and resolve inline comments cleanly.
- **Self-Contained:** Handles standard App Password configuration or dynamically processes interactive OAuth 2.0 flows on local workstations.
