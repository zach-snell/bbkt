This guide will help you set up `bbkt` and start using it with your AI assistant to manage your Bitbucket workspace.

## Prerequisites

- An Atlassian API Token (or App Password)
- An MCP-compatible AI client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

## Setup

<Steps>

1. **Install bbkt**

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Installation Script">
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/zach-snell/bbkt.git
       cd bbkt
       ./install.sh
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Go">
       ```bash
       go install github.com/zach-snell/bbkt@latest
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. **Configure your MCP client**

   Add `bbkt` to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "bitbucket": {
         "command": "bbkt",
         "args": ["mcp"],
         "env": {
           "BITBUCKET_USERNAME": "your-username",
           "BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart your AI client**

   Close and reopen Claude Desktop (or your MCP client) to load the new server.

4. **Start chatting!**

   You can now ask your AI assistant to interact with your Bitbucket repositories.

</Steps>

## First Commands to Try

Once configured, try asking your AI assistant:

### View your repositories

> "Show me my repositories in the 'acme-corp' workspace"

> "List all open pull requests in the 'frontend-app' repo"

### Manage code and reviews

> "Approve the latest pull request on 'backend-api'"

> "Comment on line 42 of PR #12 saying 'This logic looks fragile'"

### Trigger pipelines

> "Run the deployment pipeline for the `main` branch"

> "Check the status of the failing pipeline run"

## Example Conversation

Here's a typical interaction using our new, highly-efficient multiplexed tools:

**You**: "Create a new branch called 'feature/new-login' in the 'auth-service' repo"

**Assistant**: *Uses the `manage_refs` tool with action="create-branch"*

> Branch `feature/new-login` has been created from `main`.

**You**: "Can you open a PR for this new branch into main with the title 'Add OAuth Support'?"

**Assistant**: *Uses the `manage_pull_requests` tool with action="create"*

> Pull request #45 has been created: **Add OAuth Support**.
> - Source: `feature/new-login`
> - Destination: `main`
